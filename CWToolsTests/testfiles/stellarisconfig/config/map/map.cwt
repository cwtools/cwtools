#NOTE 1
#the map component has two sub-folders. With the setup_scenerios folder there should be no problem as it is.
#but the game/map/galaxy folder poses two problems: there is one file there called base.txt
#this was formarly a lua file - so its a sort of defines file. The way it works is that it has overwrites within the same folder
#each file - elliptical.txt, ring.txt, spiral_2.txt and spiral_4.txt has a value, and potentially more
#that overwrites the values in base.txt. It seems to me that the filename for these acts as a key, and that key is loaded from a setup scenerio
#in what i so far defined as an enum[galaxy_shapes]. Thus there is a different verification procedure necessary for this folder.

#NOTE 2
#some settings in this folder have no containers at all. This poses a problem.
