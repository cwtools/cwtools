== SCOPE DOCUMENTATION ==
These work as context switches (links) in triggers and effects (e.g. 'owner = { <triggers/effects> }'), or as targets of triggers and effects (e.g. 'is_owned_by = from'). Dot scoping (e.g. root.owner.capital_scope) is allowed.

== LOCALIZATION DOCUMENTATION ==
This is a list of all hardcoded scoped localization commands in the game. It does not include scripted locs (see game/customizable_localization).
In most cases, it is also possible to get the value of variables: [Scope.my_variable].
There are also several unscoped commands: GetDate, GetMidGameDate, GetLateGameDate, GetYear, LastKilledCountryName.
A single opening square bracket '[' will begin a scoped localization statement.
Two consecutive opening square brackets '[[' will escape it, making a single square bracket show up in text instead, i.e. '[[example]' in loc will display as '[example]' in-game.
