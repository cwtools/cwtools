However, other (previously marginal) voices celebrate the generosity of the [root.GetRulerTitle].

It seems that they have been channelling large portions of their departments' government budgets into their own pockets, and from there into off-world asteroid tax havens, costing the state millions. There is widespread outrage at this revelation, and troublemakers are quick to accuse those who appointed them of collusion. \n\nHow will you deal with the situation?"

Religious leaders have moved swiftly to denounce [root.GetRulerName], and have demanded that [root.leader.GetSheHe] be deemed unfit to lead the [root.GetName]. Many citizens have rallied behind these calls. However, the [root.GetRulerTitle]'s supporters have rallied around [root.leader.GetHimHer], pointing out that [root.leader.GetSheHe] [root.leader.GetHasHave] been one of the [root.GetName]'s most capable leaders ever, and is well-respected among [root.leader.GetHisHer] peers on the galactic stage.\n\nWhat should be done about the situation?"

Unfortunately, the evidence is both compelling and largely accurate.
